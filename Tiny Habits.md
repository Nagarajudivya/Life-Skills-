# Habits & Behavior Change

## Most Interesting Story or Idea — Tiny Habits (BJ Fogg)

The most interesting idea was how **BJ Fogg** suggests making habits so incredibly small that they are almost impossible to fail — for example, doing just one tiny action like a single push-up after a regular daily activity. This makes starting and sticking to habits much easier and more consistent. It showed that big change doesn't come from big goals, but from **tiny, consistent actions anchored to routines**.

## How Can You Use B = MAP to Make New Habits Easier?

**B = MAP** is a simple formula that explains how habits are formed. A behavior (B) will only happen when **M**, **A**, and **P** occur at the same time:

- **M = Motivation** — How much you want to do the action.
- **A = Ability** — How easy or hard the action is for you to do.
- **P = Prompt** — The cue or trigger that reminds you to perform the action.

## Why is it Important to "Shine" or Celebrate After Each Habit?

It is important to celebrate after completing a habit because **celebration creates positive emotions**, and positive emotions wire the habit into our brain. When we feel good immediately after doing a behavior, our brain associates that action with success and satisfaction, making us more likely to repeat it. Whatever we celebrate becomes reinforced and gradually turns into a **lasting habit**.

## Most Interesting Idea — 1% Better Every Day

The most interesting idea in the *1% Better Every Day* video was the concept that **tiny daily improvements — even just 1% — compound over time into massive change**. It showed that you don't need dramatic overnight success. Consistent small progress every day eventually leads to big results, making big goals feel more achievable and less overwhelming.

## The Book's Perspective on Identity

The book says true behavior change starts with **identity change** — you become someone who believes they are the type of person who does the habit (e.g., *"I am a reader," "I am a healthy person"*), rather than just focusing on outcomes or goals. Identity shapes how you see yourself, and consistent habits reinforce that identity.

## How to Make a Habit Easier to Do

To make habits easier, **reduce friction and simplify the action**. This includes:

- Breaking habits into tiny steps.
- Optimizing your environment so cues are obvious.
- Designing habits that take less effort — the easier it is to start, the more likely you are to repeat the behavior.

## How to Make a Habit Harder to Do

To break unwanted habits, **increase friction and remove cues** that trigger the habit. This means:

- Making the unwanted behavior less convenient or less visible.
- Deleting distracting apps or placing barriers between you and the habit.
- Eliminating triggers from your environment entirely.
