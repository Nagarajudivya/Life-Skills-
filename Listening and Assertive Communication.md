# Communication & Listening Skills

## What are the Steps/Strategies to do Active Listening?

- **Pay full attention**
  - Focus completely on the speaker. Avoid distractions like mobile phones, side conversations, or thinking about your reply while the other person is speaking.

- **Maintain eye contact and positive body language**
  - Use appropriate eye contact, nod your head, and keep an open posture to show interest and encouragement.

- **Listen without interrupting**
  - Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts without cutting in. Interrupting can break their flow and make them feel unheard.

- **Ask relevant questions**
  - Ask clarifying or open-ended questions to better understand the message and show genuine interest.

- **Paraphrase and summarize**
  - Restate what the speaker said in your own words to confirm understanding and avoid misinterpretation.

- **Provide thoughtful feedback**
  - Respond appropriately after listening completely, showing that you have understood both the message and emotions involved.

## Key Points of Reflective Listening

- **Listen carefully without interrupting**
  - The listener should give full attention to the speaker and allow them to complete their message.

- **Understand both words and emotions**
  - Reflective listening focuses not only on what is said, but also on how the speaker feels while saying it.

- **Reflect or repeat the message in your own words**
  - The listener restates the speaker's main points to show understanding and avoid confusion.

- **Verify accuracy with the speaker**
  - After reflecting the message, the listener asks the speaker to confirm whether the understanding is correct.

- **Use appropriate body language and tone**
  - Eye contact and a calm tone help show interest and support.

- **Clarify doubts immediately**
  - If something is unclear, the listener asks questions instead of making assumptions.

## When Do You Switch to a Passive Communication Style?

I switch to passive communication when I want to avoid conflict or do not want to upset others. This usually happens when talking to seniors, teachers, managers, or elders. I may stay quiet even if I disagree, avoid expressing my opinions, or accept decisions without questioning them. I also become passive when I lack confidence or feel that my opinion may not be valued.

## When Do You Switch to an Aggressive Communication Style?

I tend to become aggressive when I feel stressed, frustrated, or repeatedly ignored. This may happen when deadlines are tight, when someone does not listen to me, or when I feel treated unfairly. In such situations, my tone may become harsh, and I may speak loudly or impatiently instead of calmly explaining my point.

## When Do You Switch to a Passive-Aggressive Communication Style?

I switch to passive-aggressive communication when I am uncomfortable expressing my feelings directly. This often happens when I am annoyed but do not want to confront the person openly. Instead, I may use sarcasm, indirect comments, silence, or complain to others. This usually occurs in group settings or personal relationships where open confrontation feels difficult.

## How Can You Make Your Communication Assertive?

- Express thoughts clearly and respectfully without being silent or rude.
- Use **"I" statements** such as *"I feel"* or *"I think"* instead of blaming others.
- Maintain calm body language and tone while speaking confidently.
- Listen actively to others and acknowledge their viewpoint before responding.
- Set healthy boundaries by saying **"no"** politely when required.
- Practice self-confidence and remind yourself that your opinions are valid.
