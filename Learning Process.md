## Most Interesting Story or Idea

One of the most interesting ideas is how famous thinkers like **Salvador Dalí** and **Thomas Edison** used relaxed thinking to spark creativity.

When Dalí got stuck on a problem, he would sit in a chair holding keys, relax his mind, and as he drifted into a light doze, the keys would fall and wake him up. At that moment, his brain had made new connections in the background, and he could bring these insights into focused thinking to work on his art. Edison used a similar technique with ball bearings in his hands.

This idea — that resting or relaxed thinking can generate breakthroughs — was especially surprising and inspiring because it shows that **creativity doesn't only come from intense focus**, but also from giving your brain space to wander and connect ideas in new ways.

## What Are Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking?

- **Active (Focused) Mode**
  - This is when you concentrate closely on something like solving a problem or studying a concept. Your attention is directed at specific details and familiar ideas. This mode is great for deeply analyzing information you already know but can get you stuck if you are trying to solve something entirely new.

- **Diffused (Relaxed) Mode**
  - This mode happens when your brain is more relaxed and not concentrating on the task directly — for example, when you are taking a walk, showering, or resting. In the diffuse mode, your brain makes broader connections between ideas and can come up with creative solutions or new perspectives that are not obvious when you are intensely focused.

## Steps to Take When Approaching a New Topic

- **Deconstruct the skill**
  - Break the topic or skill into smaller, manageable parts to focus on first.

- **Learn enough to self-correct**
  - Gather a few reliable resources so you can recognize and fix your own mistakes while practicing.

- **Remove barriers to practice**
  - Eliminate distractions and anything that stops you from practicing consistently.

## Actions to Improve Your Learning Process

- Practice **deep work** by studying with full focus and sustained attention.
- Keep the phone on silent, remove unnecessary notifications, and block social media during study hours.
- Follow the rule *"work when you work, play when you play"* to avoid distractions.
- Track study time using productivity apps to stay disciplined and improve consistency.
- Use techniques like the **Feynman Technique** to ensure deep understanding.
- Focus more on **concept clarity** rather than just completing tasks for deadlines.
- Make learning interesting and enjoyable by using examples and real-world applications.
- Aim to **master a few core skills deeply** instead of trying to learn everything at once.
